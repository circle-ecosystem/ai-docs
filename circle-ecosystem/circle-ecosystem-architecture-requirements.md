- Conversational AI agent
- API gateway and management
- Analytics and reporting
- “Client Admin Portal” that provides web-based interfaces for administering foundational services.

## 6. Architecture Principles

### 6.1 Core Principles

1. **Independent Applications**: All applications (Circle Hub and Circle Partner Apps) function as standalone products, not plugins or add-ons
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: All applications must support iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Web platforms
3. **Deep Integration**: Applications must integrate seamlessly via standardized protocols
4. **Unified Authentication**: Single sign-on across all ecosystem applications
5. **Multi-Tenancy**: Support for data isolation between organizations
6. **API-First Design**: All functionality exposed through well-defined APIs
7. **Extensibility**: Architecture designed to accommodate future expansion

## 7. Functional Requirements

- Implement consistent user experience patterns

### 7.3 External App Integration Requirements

- Connect to external platforms via their respective APIs
- Translate between Circle ecosystem events and third-party platform events
- Handle authentication with external platforms
